# External Discovery and Reuse

## Activation
Use this skill before substantial new capability/subsystem/framework/algorithm/model/agent mechanism/protocol/infrastructure/evaluation-system work, difficult custom mechanisms, major rewrites, repeated failed attempts, unfamiliar domains, major course corrections, material requirement changes, or novelty claims.

Routine fixes inside established architecture do not require exhaustive discovery.

## Search method
Search the underlying problem, not only project-specific names.

Use appropriate sources such as:
- GitHub/GitLab;
- package registries;
- research papers/arXiv;
- Hugging Face/model hubs;
- standards/protocols;
- SDKs/APIs/frameworks;
- academic projects;
- benchmarks/datasets;
- adjacent technical disciplines.

Scale research depth to the decision's cost and importance.

## Evaluate serious candidates
Consider:
- functional overlap;
- architecture/API fit;
- license/provenance;
- maintenance/community maturity;
- security posture;
- tests/documentation;
- dependencies;
- determinism/performance limits;
- migration/integration cost;
- regression/revalidation cost;
- long-term maintenance.

Classify material candidates as:
`ADOPT | WRAP | EXTEND | FORK | COMPOSE | REFERENCE | BENCHMARK | BUILD | REJECT`

## Existing qualified work
External discovery does not automatically authorize replacement. Preserve stable/qualified work unless the material future benefit justifies migration, regression, revalidation, dependency, governance, and maintenance costs.

If a discovery materially changes the strategic choice, return it to the Architect instead of silently re-architecting the project.

## Record
When discovery materially affects current/future decisions, append a concise entry to `.agent/EXTERNAL.md` including source, freshness, overlap, disposition, rationale, and recheck trigger.
